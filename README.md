# Assignment-3

1. delete everything in the simplenotepad.java and copy them to the uiStructure since we need to divide the function and ui instead of making them in a single class

2. change a branch of variable names orginally in simplenotepad.java(now in uistructure.java) to a longer but clearer name. 

3. instead of doing everything in the actionperformed, now the actionperformed will only the strategy class, and the strategy class will decide what is going to do next. This will make the function no longer exist in the ui class.

4.delete some useless code
